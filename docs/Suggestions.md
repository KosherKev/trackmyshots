Encrypted Backup & Restore
Cascading Schedule Updates:If Dose 1 is marked "Administered" on a late date, the app should ask: "Do you want to shift future dependent doses based on this new date?”.

Tech: Use the workmanager package alongside notifications to periodically check and refresh schedules.

UI: Add a "Check Permissions" dashboard in Settings that explicitly guides users to turn off "Battery Optimization" for this app.

Ensure the architecture supports Multi-Profile Management from Day 1. The dashboard needs a dropdown to switch between "Kwame" and "Ama" instantly.

Strengths (Internal)	Weaknesses (Internal)
Privacy: "No Cloud" is a huge selling point for privacy-conscious users.


Offline: Works perfectly in areas with bad network (very relevant for Ghana).


Smart Conflicts: Prioritizing appointments over generic reminders prevents annoyance.

Data Risk: Local-only storage means high risk of data loss.


Manual Entry: Requires discipline; if the user forgets to log a shot, the app becomes useless.

Opportunities (External)	Threats (External)
Digitization Push: Fits into the global trend of digital health.


Partnerships: pediatric clinics or maternity wards could recommend this app.

OS Updates: Android updates often break local notification logic.


Medical Liability: If the app calculates a date wrong and a child gets sick, is the developer liable? (Need a disclaimer).


Strategy 1: The "Freemium" Utility (One-Time Purchases)

Instead of a monthly sub, charge small "convenience fees" for specific outputs.

The Feature: "School Admission Report."

The Pitch: When a child starts crèche or nursery, schools demand proof of immunization.

The Monetization: The tracking is free. But if they want a clean, professional PDF Export of the vaccination history to print for the school, charge a small one-time fee (e.g., GHS 15 via Momo).

Strategy 2: Hyper-Local Marketplace (Affiliate/Lead Gen)

This is the most potent strategy for Ghana. Users won't pay you, but they will buy products.

The Logic: You have an audience of parents with babies. They constantly need diapers, wipes, paracetamol, and formula.

The Implementation:

Create a "Resources" or "Essentials" tab.

Partner with Jumia, Amalinks, or local pharmacies.

Contextual Recommendation: When the app reminds them of the "6-month shots" (which can cause fever), show a subtle "Recommended: Calpol/Paracetamol for post-vaccine fever - Buy Now" link.

You earn a commission on every sale.

Strategy 3: B2B "Sponsorship" (The Billboard Model)

The Logic: Baby brands (Cerelac, Pampers, Cusson's Baby) are desperate to reach mothers of specific age groups.

The Implementation:

Offer a "Sponsored by" section in the Education Hub.

Example: The article on "Skin Care for Newborns" is "Brought to you by Cusson's Baby."

This is not an intrusive pop-up ad; it is native branding.

Strategy 4: Telemedicine Lite (Premium Tier)

The Feature: "Ask a Nurse."

The Pitch: Connect the user to a WhatsApp bot or a direct line to a partner pediatric nurse for quick questions.

The Monetization: Users subscribe (small monthly fee) to have access to this "Medical Concierge."
